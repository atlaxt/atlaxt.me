# Atlas Yiğit Aydın

Hi! I'm Atlas Yiğit Aydın — a passionate frontend developer and digital creator.

I spend most of my time building fast, accessible, and user-focused interfaces. I enjoy creating tools and projects that boost productivity and save developers time.

I'm currently working as a frontend developer at **trex Digital Manufacturing**, where I'm responsible for building user interfaces for ERP systems and internal applications. Outside of work, I actively contribute to the open-source ecosystem and build my own side projects.

While I mostly focus on developing UI components, developer tools, and test API services, my work isn't limited to just those. I like crafting solutions based on different needs and taking ownership of the entire process from start to finish. You can find more details on the [projects](/projects) page.

Outside of code, I enjoy taking photos and collecting little things that catch my eye. If you're curious, feel free to [check out my photo collection](/photos).

If we share common interests — or even if you just want to say hi — feel free to reach out. Who knows, we might grab a coffee and create something together.
