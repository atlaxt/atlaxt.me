# Atlas Yiğit Aydın

I am a Web Developer primarily focused on the **Nuxt** ecosystem. I spend most of my time building fast, accessible, and user-focused interfaces that boost productivity and save developers time.

Currently, I continue my career at [trex Digital Manufacturing](https://trex.com.tr), where I develop modern pre-accounting software solutions alongside my team. My ultimate goal is to go beyond functional code and deliver top-tier **User Experience (UX)** in every product I build.

Outside of professional work, I actively contribute to the [open-source](/projects) community and build my own side projects. I am also a photographer who loves viewing life through a [viewfinder](/photos), and a dedicated reader determined to complete the **Modern Classics** canon.

If we share common interests — or even if you just want to say hi — feel free to reach out. Who knows, we might grab a coffee and create something together.
